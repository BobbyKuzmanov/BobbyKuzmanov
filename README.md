Hi My name is Bobby Kuzmanov!



I've been doodling with backend development for quiet some time now, and absolutely love it. After going through little bit C# and now with Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS and PostgreSQL I decide that is it something want to go long term.

Here on GitHub, you'll find a collection of my repositories showcasing my coding prowess, from small utility scripts to larger, more ambitious projects. I believe in the power of open-source collaboration and am committed to sharing my learnings and contributing to the community whenever possible.

Feel free to explore my repositories, contribute to ongoing projects, or reach out for collaboration opportunities. Let's connect and build something awesome together!
Happy coding! ðŸš€
